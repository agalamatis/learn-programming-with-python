# learn-programming-with-python
An introduction to programming for absolute beginners using python.

## Structure
This repository is organised in subdirectories preceded by a number and followed by the title of the unit. In each subdirectory there is find a `README.md` file with discussion and examples of the material covered and projects for practice. In addition, there is an `assignment.py` file with a series of exercises that you should edit with your solution in a new branch and a `test_assignment.py` that will automatically check your solutions by run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover unit_1_basics
```
Ignore the empty `__init__.py`; all these will make perfect sense by the time you have worked the material of unit 6.

## Order of Study
The units are intended to be studied in order, but depending on your motivation you might want to skip ahead or stop early.
Units 1-4 are the bare essiantials. After mastering their material, one can:

* begin using python for symbolic algebra (sympy), numerical analysis (scipy) and machine learning (scikit-learn)
* begin using aws-chalice for serverless apps
* automate basic tasks on his computer

After unit 5 (even though 6 is strongly recommended too) one can begin to learning a web development framework, like Django or Flask.

## TODO: getting python 3.6
TODO: introduce pip now or wait until the end of unit 2 after explaining modules

## TODO: the interpreter

## TODO: venv?

## TODO: The elephant in the room... mathematics
TODO: The tutorial tries either to skip or very gently introduce mathematical concepts to keep those not versed in the field engaged, while those that are can still see the underlying principles. All that said and writen there is no way around it, to become a decent software engineer, independent of the language one must study mathematics at university level. Many have made careers without, but their roles were tangent to the actual code efficiency, maintainability and readability. Computer science is after all a subdisciplines of mathematics and the more advanced knowledge on has in the field the easier and faster the progress will be with this tutorial, the python language or any other.
