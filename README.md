# learn-programming-with-python
An introduction to programming for absolute beginners using python.

## Structure
This repository is organised in subdirectories preceded by a number and followed by the title of the unit. In each subdirectory there is find a `README.md` file with discussion and examples of the material covered and projects for practice. In addition, there is an `assignment.py` file with a series of exercises that you should edit with your solution in a new branch and a `test_assignment.py` that will automatically check your solutions by run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover unit_1_basics
```
For now ignore the `__init__.py` all these will make perfect sense by the time you have worked the material of unit 6.

## Order of Study
The units are intended to be studied in order, but depending on your motivation you might want to skip ahead or stop early.
Units 1-4 are the bare essiantials. After studying those, one can:

* begin using python for symbolic algebra (sympy), numerical and/or statistical analysis (scipy) and machine learning (scikit-learn)
* begin using aws-chalice for serverless
* automate basic tasks on his computer

After unit 5 (even though 6 is strongly recommended too) one can begin to learning a web development framework, like Djano or Flask.
